# Likelihood-based privacy attack.
In this repository, we open-source our privacy attack from our paper. This privacy attack allows you to measure the associated privacy risk of your (protected) data set. The privacy risk is estimated within the framework of differential privacy: 

$\hat{\varepsilon} =\max \left(\log \left(\frac{1-(1/N)-\text{FPR}}{\text{FNR}}\right), \log \left(\frac{1-(1/N)-\text{FNR}}{\text{FPR}}\right)\right),$

where _N_ is the sample size. _FPR_ is the false positive rate (or probability of membership given non-membership of the training data); _FNR_ is the false negative rate (or probability of membership given non-membership of the training data). 

## Likelihood-based privacy attack code
We provide a function that replicates our privacy attack in likelihood_privacy_attack.py. This function requires the following parameters: 

1. `seed`: a random seed for replication purposes.
2. `simulations`: the number of simulations.
3. `train`: requires the real training set.
4. `adversary`: requires the adversary set.
5. `outside_training`: requires observations that were not seen during training or adversary.
6. `protected_training`: requires the protected training data (protected version of `train`).
7. `protected_adversary`: requires the protected adversary data (protected version of `adversary`).

## Tutorial using swapping in Python and R (see for R below).
We provide an example with public churn data here:
```python
# first we need to import some dependencies.
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# we read public churn data
url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albayraktaroglu/Datasets/master/churn.csv'
churn = pd.read_csv(url, index_col=0)

# select some variables
churn = churn.iloc[:,6:15]
samples = 300 # select the number of observations
churn = pd.DataFrame.drop_duplicates(churn) # drop duplicates

# here we create the train, adversary and outside_training set.
churn, evaluation_outside_training = train_test_split(churn, train_size = int(samples*2/3), test_size = int(samples*1/3)) 
train, adversary_training = train_test_split(churn, train_size = int(samples*1/3))

# define our data protected method. We use swapping 25% of the observations.
def swapping(percent, data):
  import random
  import numpy as np
  swap_data = data
  idx = random.randint(0,8) # pick a random variable
  variable = np.array(data.iloc[:,idx]) # select variable from data
  ix_size = int(percent * len(variable) * 0.5) # select proportion to shuffle
  ix_1 = np.random.choice(len(variable), size=ix_size, replace=False) # select rows to shuffle
  ix_2 = np.random.choice(len(variable), size=ix_size, replace=False) # select rows to shuffle
  b1 = variable[ix_1] # take rows from variable and create b
  b2 = variable[ix_2] # take rows from variable and create b

  variable[ix_2] = b1 # swap 1
  variable[ix_1] = b2 # swap 2

  swap_data.iloc[:,idx] = variable  # place variable back in original data
  return swap_data

# apply protection to train and adversary
swap25_train = swapping(percent = 0.25, data = train) # apply swapping 25% to train
swap25_adversary_training = swapping(percent = 0.25, data = adversary_training)  # apply swapping 25% to adv

# define privacy attack

    print("empirical epsilon = " + str(max(math.log((1 - (1/N) - FPR)/FNR), math.log((1 - (1/N) - FNR)/FPR))))
  return epsilons, FPR, TNR, FNR, TPR

# Apply privacy attack

```

In line with our paper, we find that swapping gives infinite privacy risk.
